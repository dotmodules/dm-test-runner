# OUTPUT CAPTURING
#==============================================================================

#==============================================================================
# During test case execution the test runner captures the standard output,
# standard error and the file descriptor 3 as an optional debugger ouput. The
# captured content will be only visible if the test case fails. Having captured
# standard error content makes the test case automatically fail.
#
# Note that the captured outputs might not be printed in the exact order as the
# test case executes them. This is due to the way the test runner captures the
# outputs with processing commands running as a background command, having no
# control over the timings.
#
# If the tested code outputs too much in its outputs, the related capturing
# processes might not be able to keep up with the rate, and might not be able
# to process all output lines before a failing assertion exits from the test
# case execution. Therefore the executor code has to make sure that the
# capturing processes has not effected by the exit call due to the failed
# assertion. This can be achieved by executing the test case in another
# subshell inside the capturing function.
